# NLP_Ecomerce_searching_engine

This project is my take on the following challenge: https://github.com/Lhotse-Technologies/take-home-data-scientist (read the description in the repository).

The objective was to come up with an efficient matching algorithm that would recomend the items and the manufacturers listed in a database based on the user's unstrucutred description of their desired prodocut. A priority of the project was 1. relativelly high accuracy in recomindation (that can be assessed heuristically by anyone: by typing in a query and observing how close the results of the matching are) 2. relativelly high efficiency and scalability of the algorithm (given potential growth of the database and items' list & given the possibility of large user inputs).

Our repository:
1. data.json - the raw json file provided in the challenge - the data
